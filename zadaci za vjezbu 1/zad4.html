    <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        There's a fire starting in my heart
        Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
        Finally, I can see you crystal clear
        Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
        See how I'll leave with every piece of you
        Don't underestimate the things that I will do
        There's a fire starting in my heart
        Reaching a fever pitch, and it's bringing me out the dark
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        The scars of your love remind me of us
        They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
        The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
        I can't help feeling
        
        [Chorus]
        We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        
        [Verse 2]
        Baby, I have no story to be told
        But I've heard one on you, now I'm gonna make your head burn
        Think of me in the depths of your despair
        Make a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared
        
        [Pre-Chorus]
        (You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love remind me of us
        (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) They keep me thinkin' that we almost had it all
        (You're gonna wish you never had met me) The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
        (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep) I can't help feeling
        
        [Chorus]
        We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        Could've had it all
        Rolling in the deep
        You had my heart inside of your hand
        But you played it with a beating
        
        [Bridge]
        Throw your soul through every open door (Ooh woah, oh)
        Count your blessings to find what you look for (Woah)
        Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Ooh woah, oh)
        You'll pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow
        
        [Breakdown]
        (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        We could've had it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        We could've had it all, yeah (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        It all, it all, it all (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        
        [Chorus]
        We could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        Could've had it all (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
        You had my heart inside of your hand (You're gonna wish you never had met me)
        But you played it, you played it, you played it
        You played it to the beat

    <h1 id="song2"> Someone like you </h1>
    <pre>
            [Verse 1]
            I heard that you're settled down
            That you found a girl and you're married now
            I heard that your dreams came true
            Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
            Old friend, why are you so shy?
            Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

            [Pre-Chorus]
            I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
            But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
            I had hoped you'd see my face
            And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

            [Chorus]
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too
            Don't forget me, I beg
            I remember you said
            Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
            Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

            [Verse 2]
            You know how the time flies
            Only yesterday was the time of our lives
            We were born and raised in a summer haze
            Bound by the surprise of our glory days

            [Pre-Chorus]
            I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
            But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
            I had hoped you'd see my face
            And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over

            [Chorus]
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too
            Don't forget me, I beg
            I remember you said
            Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

            [Bridge]
            Nothing compares, no worries or cares
            Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
            Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?

            [Breakdown]
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you
            Don't forget me, I beg
            I remember you said
            Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

            [Chorus]
            Never mind, I'll find someone like you
            I wish nothing but the best for you, too
            Don't forget me, I beg
            I remember you said
            Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
            Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

    <h1 id="song3"> Hello </h1>
    <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        Hello, it's me
        I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
        To go over everything
        They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
        Hello, can you hear me?
        I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
        When we were younger and free
        I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

        [Pre-Chorus]
        There's such a difference between us
        And a million miles

        [Chorus]
        Hello from the other side
        I must've called a thousand times
        To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
        But when I call, you never seem to be home
        Hello from the outside
        At least, I can say that I've tried
        To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

        [Verse 2]
        Hello, how are you?
        It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
        I hope that you're well
        Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

        [Pre-Chorus]
        It's no secret that the both of us
        Are running out of time

        [Chorus]
        So hello from the other side (Other side)
        I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
        To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
        But when I call, you never seem to be home
        Hello from the outside (Outside)
        At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
        To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

        [Bridge]
        (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
        Ooh, anymore
        (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
        Ooh, anymore
        (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
        Ooh, anymore
        (Highs, highs, highs, highs, lows, lows, lows, lows)
        Anymore

        [Chorus]
        Hello from the other side (Other side)
        I must've called a thousand times (Thousand times)
        To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
        But when I call, you never seem to be home
        Hello from the outside (Outside)
        At least, I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
        To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
        But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

    <h1 id="song4"> Set Fire to the Rain </h1>
    <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        I let it fall, my heart
        And as it fell, you rose to claim it
        It was dark, and I was over
        Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
        My hands, they were strong
        But my knees were far too weak
        To stand in your arms
        Without falling to your feet

        [Pre-Chorus]
        But there's a side to you
        That I never knew, never knew
        All the things you'd say
        They were never true, never true
        And the games you'd play
        You would always win, always win

        [Chorus]
        But I set fire to the rain
        Watched it pour as I touched your face
        Well, it burned while I cried
        'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
        Your name

        [Verse 2]
        When I lay with you
        I could stay there, close my eyes
        Feel you here forever
        You and me together, nothing is better

        [Pre-Chorus]
        'Cause there's a side to you
        That I never knew, never knew
        All the things you'd say
        They were never true, never true
        And the games you'd play
        You would always win, always win

        [Chorus]
        But I set fire to the rain
        Watched it pour as I touched your face
        Well, it burned while I cried
        'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
        Your name
        I set fire to the rain
        And I threw us into the flames
        When it fell, somethin' died
        'Cause I knew that that was the last time
        The last time

        [Bridge]
        Sometimes, I wake up by the door
        That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
        Even now, when we're already over
        I can't help myself from lookin' for you

        [Chorus]
        I set fire to the rain
        Watched it pour as I touched your face
        Well, it burned while I cried
        'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
        Your name
        I set fire to the rain
        And I threw us into the flames
        When it fell, somethin' died
        'Cause I knew that that was the last time
        The last time

        [Outro]
        Oh
        Oh, no
        Let it burn
        Oh
        Let it burn
        Let it burn
    </pre>

    <h1 id="song5"> Skyfall </h1>
    <pre>
        [Verse 1]
        This is the end
        Hold your breath and count to ten
        Feel the Earth move, and then
        Hear my heart burst again
        For this is the end
        I've drowned and dreamt this moment
        So overdue, I owe them
        Swept away, I'm stolen

        [Chorus]
        Let the sky fall
        When it crumbles
        We will stand tall
        Face it all together
        Let the sky fall
        When it crumbles
        We will stand tall
        Face it all together
        At Skyfall
        At Skyfall

        [Verse 2]
        Skyfall is where we start
        A thousand miles and poles apart
        Where worlds collide and days are dark
        You may have my number
        You can take my name
        But you'll never have my heart

        [Chorus]
        Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
        When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
        We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
        Face it all together
        Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
        When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
        We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
        Face it all together
        At Skyfall
        Let the sky fall
        When it crumbles
        We will stand tall
        Let the sky fall
        When it crumbles
        We will stand tall

        [Bridge]
        Where you go I go
        What you see I see
        I know I'd never be me
        Without the security
        Of your loving arms
        Keeping me from harm
        Put your hand in my hand
        And we'll stand

        [Chorus]
        Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
        When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
        We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
        Face it all together
        Let the sky fall (Let the Skyfall)
        When it crumbles (When it crumbles)
        We will stand tall (We will stand tall)
        Face it all together
        At Skyfall
        Let the sky fall
        We will stand tall
        At Skyfall
